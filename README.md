# About Parkman
Park Man was born out of a simple idea to provide people with a better way to find parking and car wash services. We understood the frustrations of endlessly searching for a parking spot and the desire for a clean and sparkling car. That's when we decided to create a platform that would revolutionize the way you experience these everyday tasks.
